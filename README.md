# Gator Bioinformatics

## Data Visualization in Python
## Fall 2017

## About this workshop
The workshop builds on the UF DSI Data Visualization workshops, adding new tools and focusing on bioinformatics data and analyses. It assumes basic familiarity with Python, but should be clear enough for new users too.
