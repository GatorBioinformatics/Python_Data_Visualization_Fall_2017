# Gator Bioinformatics

## Data Visualization in Python
## Fall 2017

## About this workshop
The workshop builds on the UF DSI Data Visualization workshops, adding new tools and focusing on bioinformatics data and analyses. It assumes basic familiarity with Python, but should be clear enough for new users too.

This workshop was first presented by Matt Gitzendanner on 11/6/17. Contact Matt at magitz@ufl.edu.

## Before the workshop

- For this workshop we will be using Anaconda Python. Please download and install Anaconda on your computer from [Anaconda Python Download Site](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
    - There are Mac, Windows and Linux versions
    - We will be using the Python 3.6. **Note this is different than the Python 2.7 used in the UF DSI workshops**. If you have 2.7, it would be best to install the 3.6 version for this workshop.

## Getting started
- On Mac and Linux:
    - Open the Terminal application (For Mac: /Applications/Utilities/Terminal)
    - Type `jupyter notebook` and hit return
    - Open your web browser and it should open a new window with the Notebook.
- On Windows:
    - Open Anaconda
    - Got to the Anaconda prompt
    - Type `jupyter notebook` and hit return
    - Open your web browser and it should open a new window with the Notebook.
- Should look like this:

- Click the New button and select Python 3.

## Exercise 1:
The first exercise will walk though some basic data analysis and plotting.
Use the [Plotting_student.ipynb](Plotting_student.ipynb) notebook to work through the steps.
If you get stuck the [Plotting_instructor.ipynb](Plotting_instructor.ipynb) notebook has all the steps completed.

## Exercise 2:

The second exercise is taken from Justin Bois and Griffin Chure's page on [image processing with scikit-image](http://justinbois.github.io/bootcamp/2016/lessons/l38_intro_to_image_processing.html). This is a great source, and rather than reproduce everything here, open up that page in one window and a jupyter notebook in the other window and paste the code fragments into your notebook. The [SciKit.ipynb](SciKit.ipynb) is a completed notebook that shows everything and could be used if you get stuck.
